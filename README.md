# BoardGame Bot
This is a Discord bot to handle our Boardgame Library sharing

It uses two main packages to do this:
  1. [`discordx`](https://github.com/oceanroleplay/discord.ts)
  2. [`google-spreadsheet`](https://github.com/theoephraim/node-google-spreadsheet)

Here's [our Game Library](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a810UJgdThUsn3syFa0K20i_SVJR-k7K66Hj9X5W0i0/edit#gid=0)
